This Sign Language Detection project leverages computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures and translate them into text in real-time. It aims to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing impairments by providing an AI-powered solution for sign language recognition. The model is trained on a dataset of hand gestures and can detect multiple signs with high accuracy.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time sign language recognition using a webcam 📷
✅ Deep learning-based gesture classification (CNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers)
✅ User-friendly interface with a web or desktop app
✅ Supports multiple gestures from a pre-trained dataset
✅ Easily expandable to recognize more signs or integrate with voice output

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 🐍 for scripting and model implementation
OpenCV for real-time video processing
TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning
Flask/Streamlit for the web interface
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization
